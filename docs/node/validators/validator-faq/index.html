The role of validators is to run a full node and participate in consensus by broadcasting votes that contain cryptographic signatures signed by the validator&#x27;s private key. Validators commit new blocks in the blockchain and receive revenue in exchange for their work. Validators must also participate in governance by voting on proposals. Validators are weighted according to their total stake.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-staking">What is staking?<a href="#what-is-staking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is staking?" title="Direct link to What is staking?">â</a></h3><p>The CrossFi Chain is a public Proof-Of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, meaning that the weight of validators is determined by the amount of staking tokens (MPX) bonded as collateral. These MPX tokens can be self-delegated directly by the validator or delegated to the validator by other MPX holders.</p><p>Any user in the system can declare their intention to become a validator by sending a <code>create-validator</code> transaction to become validator candidates.</p><p>The weight (i.e. voting power) of a validator determines whether they are an active validator. The active validator set is limited to <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an amount</a> that changes over time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-full-node">What is a full node?<a href="#what-is-a-full-node" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is a full node?" title="Direct link to What is a full node?">â</a></h3><p>A full node is a server running a chain&#x27;s <em>binary</em> (its software) that fully validates transactions and blocks of a blockchain and keeps a full record of all historic activity. A full node is distinct from a pruned node that processes only block headers and a small subset of transactions. Running a full node requires more resources than a pruned node. Validators can decide to run either a full node or a pruned node, but they need to make sure they retain enough blocks to be able to validate new blocks.</p><p>Of course, it is possible and encouraged for users to run full nodes even if they do not plan to be validators.</p><p>You can find more details about the requirements in the <a href="/docs/node/hub-tutorials/join-mainnet.md">Joining Mainnet Tutorial</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-delegator">What is a delegator?<a href="#what-is-a-delegator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is a delegator?" title="Direct link to What is a delegator?">â</a></h3><p>Delegators are MPX holders who cannot, or do not want to, run a validator themselves. MPX holders can delegate MPX to a validator and obtain a part of their revenue in exchange. For details on how revenue is distributed, see <a href="#what-is-the-incentive-to-stake?">What is the incentive to stake?</a> and <a href="#what-are-validators-commission?">What are validators commission?</a> in this document.</p><p>Because delegators share revenue with their validators, they also share risks. If a validator misbehaves, each of their delegators are partially slashed in proportion to their delegated stake. This penalty is one of the reasons why delegators must perform due diligence on validators before delegating. Spreading their stake over multiple validators is another layer of protection.</p><p>Delegators play a critical role in the system, as they are responsible for choosing validators. Being a delegator is not a passive role. Delegators must actively monitor the actions of their validators and participate in governance. For details on being a delegator, read the <a href="https://hub.cosmos.network/main/delegators/delegator-faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delegator FAQ</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="becoming-a-validator">Becoming a Validator<a href="#becoming-a-validator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Becoming a Validator" title="Direct link to Becoming a Validator">â</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-become-a-validator">How to become a validator?<a href="#how-to-become-a-validator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to become a validator?" title="Direct link to How to become a validator?">â</a></h3><p>Any participant in the network can signal that they want to become a validator by sending a <code>create-validator</code> transaction, where they must fill out the following parameters:</p><ul><li><strong>Validator&#x27;s <code>PubKey</code>:</strong> The private key associated with this Tendermint <code>PubKey</code> is used to sign <em>prevotes</em> and <em>precommits</em>.</li><li><strong>Validator&#x27;s Address:</strong> Application level address that is used to publicly identify your validator. The private key associated with this address is used to delegate, unbond, claim rewards, and participate in governance.</li><li><strong>Validator&#x27;s name (moniker)</strong></li><li><strong>Validator&#x27;s website (Optional)</strong></li><li><strong>Validator&#x27;s description (Optional)</strong></li><li><strong>Initial commission rate</strong>: The commission rate on block rewards and fees charged to delegators.</li><li><strong>Maximum commission:</strong> The maximum commission rate that this validator can charge. This parameter is fixed and cannot be changed after the <code>create-validator</code> transaction is processed.</li><li><strong>Commission max change rate:</strong> The maximum daily increase of the validator commission. This parameter is fixed cannot be changed after the <code>create-validator</code> transaction is processed.</li><li><strong>Minimum self-delegation:</strong> Minimum amount of MPX the validator requires to have bonded at all time. If the validator&#x27;s self-delegated stake falls below this limit, their validator gets jailed and kicked out of the active validator set.</li></ul><p>After a validator is created, MPX holders can delegate MPX to them, effectively adding stake to the validator&#x27;s pool. The total stake of an address is the combination of MPX bonded by delegators and MPX self-bonded by the validator.</p><p>From all validator candidates that signaled themselves, the 150 validators with the most total stake are the designated <strong>validators</strong>. If a validator&#x27;s total stake falls below the top 150, then that validator loses its validator privileges. The validator cannot participate in consensus or generate rewards until the stake is high enough to be in the top 150. Over time, the maximum number of validators may be increased via on-chain governance proposal.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="testnet">Testnet<a href="#testnet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Testnet" title="Direct link to Testnet">â</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-can-i-join-the-testnet">How can I join the testnet?<a href="#how-can-i-join-the-testnet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How can I join the testnet?" title="Direct link to How can I join the testnet?">â</a></h3><p>The testnet is a great environment to test your validator setup before launch.</p><p>Testnet participation is a great way to signal to the community that you are ready and able to operate a validator.

The delegated amount can be increased by sending a <code>delegate</code> transaction from your validator&#x27;s <code>application</code> application key.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="is-there-a-minimum-amount-of-mpx-that-must-be-delegated-to-be-an-active-bonded-validator">Is there a minimum amount of MPX that must be delegated to be an active (bonded) validator?<a href="#is-there-a-minimum-amount-of-mpx-that-must-be-delegated-to-be-an-active-bonded-validator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Is there a minimum amount of MPX that must be delegated to be an active (bonded) validator?" title="Direct link to Is there a minimum amount of MPX that must be delegated to be an active (bonded) validator?">â</a></h3><p>The minimum is 1 MPX.

Selection criteria includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Amount of self-delegated MPX:</strong> Number of MPX a validator self-delegated to themselves. A validator with a higher amount of self-delegated MPX indicates that the validator is sharing the risk and experienced consequences for their actions.</li><li><strong>Amount of delegated MPX:</strong> Total number of MPX delegated to a validator. A high voting power shows that the community trusts this validator. Larger validators also decrease the decentralization of the network, so delegators are suggested to consider delegating to smaller validators.</li><li><strong>Commission rate:</strong> Commission applied on revenue by validators before the revenue is distributed to their delegators.</li><li><strong>Track record:</strong> Delegators review the track record of the validators they plan to delegate to. This track record includes past votes on proposals and historical average uptime.</li><li><strong>Community contributions:</strong> Another (more subjective) criteria is the work that validators have contributed to the community, such as educational content, participation in the community channels, contributions to open source software, etc.</li></ul><p>Apart from these criteria, validators send a <code>create-validator</code> transaction to signal a website address to complete their resume. Validators must build reputation one way or another to attract delegators. For example, a good practice for validators is to have a third party audit their setup. Note though, that the Tendermint team does not approve or conduct any audits themselves.

Each delegator can value validators based on their own criteria. Validators are able to register a website address when they nominate themselves so that they can advertise their operation as they see fit. Some delegators prefer a website that clearly displays the team operating the validator and their resume, while other validators might prefer to be anonymous validators with positive track records.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-responsibilities-of-a-validator">What are the responsibilities of a validator?<a href="#what-are-the-responsibilities-of-a-validator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are the responsibilities of a validator?" title="Direct link to What are the responsibilities of a validator?">â</a></h3><p>Validators have two main responsibilities:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Be able to constantly run a correct version of the software:</strong> Validators must ensure that their servers are always online and their private keys are not compromised.</p></li><li><p><strong>Actively participate in governance:</strong> Validators are required to vote on every proposal.</p></li></ul><p>Additionally, validators are expected to be active members of the community.

As pillars of the system, validators are required to vote on every proposal. It is especially important since delegators who do not vote inherit the vote of their validator.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-staking-imply">What does staking imply?<a href="#what-does-staking-imply" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What does staking imply?" title="Direct link to What does staking imply?">â</a></h3><p>Staking MPX can be thought of as a safety deposit on validation activities. When a validator or a delegator wants to retrieve part or all of their deposit, they send an <code>unbonding</code> transaction. Then, MPX undergoes a <strong>3-week unbonding period</strong> during which they are liable to being slashed for potential misbehaviors committed by the validator before the unbonding process started.</p><p>Validators, and by association delegators, receive block rewards, fees, and have the right to participate in governance. If a validator misbehaves, a certain portion of their total stake is slashed. This means that every delegator that bonded MPX to this validator gets penalized in proportion to their bonded stake. Delegators are therefore incentivized to delegate to validators that they anticipate will function safely.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-a-validator-run-away-with-their-delegators-mpx">Can a validator run away with their delegators&#x27; MPX?<a href="#can-a-validator-run-away-with-their-delegators-mpx" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Can a validator run away with their delegators&#x27; MPX?" title="Direct link to Can a validator run away with their delegators&#x27; MPX?">â</a></h3><p>By delegating to a validator, a user delegates voting power. The more voting power a validator have, the more weight they have in the consensus and governance processes. This does not mean that the validator has custody of their delegators&#x27; MPX. <strong>A validator cannot run away with its delegator&#x27;s funds</strong>.</p><p>Even though delegated funds cannot be stolen by their validators, delegators&#x27; tokens can still be slashed by a small percentage if their validator suffers a <a href="#what-are-the-slashing-conditions">slashing event</a>, which is why we encourage due diligence when <a href="#how-do-delegators-choose-their-validators">selecting a validator</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-often-is-a-validator-chosen-to-propose-the-next-block-does-frequency-increase-with-the-quantity-of-bonded-mpx">How often is a validator chosen to propose the next block?

The frequency of being chosen is proportional to the voting power (i.e. amount of bonded MPX) of the validator. For example, if the total bonded stake across all validators is 100 MPX and a validator&#x27;s total stake is 10 MPX, then this validator is the proposer ~10% of the blocks.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-validators-of-the-crossfi-chain-required-to-validate-other-zones-in-the-cosmos-ecosystem">Are validators of the CrossFi Chain required to validate other zones in the Cosmos ecosystem?<a href="#are-validators-of-the-crossfi-chain-required-to-validate-other-zones-in-the-cosmos-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Are validators of the CrossFi Chain required to validate other zones in the Cosmos ecosystem?" title="Direct link to Are validators of the CrossFi Chain required to validate other zones in the Cosmos ecosystem?">â</a></h3><p>This depends, currently no validators are required to validate other blockchains.

The only way to safely exit a validator node running on the CrossFi Chain is by unbonding the validator&#x27;s self-delegated stake so that it falls below its minimum self-delegation limit. As a result, the validator gets jailed and kicked out of the active set of validators, without getting slashed. They can then proceed to shut down their node without risking their tokens.</p><p>It&#x27;s highly advised to inform your delegators when doing this, as they will still be bonded to your validator after it got jailed. They will need to manually unbond and they might not have been made aware of this via their preferred wallet application.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="incentives">Incentives<a href="#incentives" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Incentives" title="Direct link to Incentives">â</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-incentive-to-stake">What is the incentive to stake?<a href="#what-is-the-incentive-to-stake" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the incentive to stake?" title="Direct link to What is the incentive to stake?">â</a></h3><p>Each member of a validator&#x27;s staking pool earns different types of revenue:</p><ul><li><strong>Block rewards:</strong> Native tokens of applications (e.g. MPX on the CrossFi Chain) run by validators are inflated to produce block provisions. These provisions exist to incentivize MPX holders to bond their stake. Non-bonded MPX are diluted over time.</li><li><strong>Transaction fees:</strong> The CrossFi Chain maintains an allow list of tokens that are accepted as fee payment. The initial fee token is the <code>atom</code>.</li></ul><p>This total revenue is divided among validators&#x27; staking pools according to each validator&#x27;s weight. Then, within each validator&#x27;s staking pool the revenue is divided among delegators in proportion to each delegator&#x27;s stake. A commission on delegators&#x27; revenue is applied by the validator before it is distributed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-validator-commission">What is a validator commission?<a href="#what-is-a-validator-commission" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is a validator commission?" title="Direct link to What is a validator commission?">â</a></h3><p>Revenue received by a validator&#x27;s pool is split between the validator and their delegators. The validator can apply a commission on the part of the revenue that goes to their delegators. This commission is set as a percentage. Each validator is free to set their initial commission, maximum daily commission change rate, and maximum commission. The CrossFi Chain enforces the parameter that each validator sets. The maximum commission rate is fixed and cannot be changed. However, the commission rate itself can be changed after the validator is created as long as it does not exceed the maximum commission.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-incentive-to-run-a-validator">What is the incentive to run a validator?<a href="#what-is-the-incentive-to-run-a-validator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the incentive to run a validator?" title="Direct link to What is the incentive to run a validator?">â</a></h3><p>Validators earn proportionally more revenue than their delegators because of the commission they take on the staking rewards from their delegators.</p><p>Validators also play a major role in governance. If a delegator does not vote, they inherit the vote from their validator. This voting inheritance gives validators a major responsibility in the ecosystem.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-are-block-rewards-distributed">How are block rewards distributed?<a href="#how-are-block-rewards-distributed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How are block rewards distributed?" title="Direct link to How are block rewards distributed?">â</a></h3><p>Block rewards are distributed proportionally to all validators relative to their voting power. This means that even though each validator gains MPX with each reward, all validators maintain equal weight over time.</p><p>For example, 10 validators have equal voting power and a commission rate of 1%. For this example, the reward for a block is 1000 MPX and each validator has 20% of self-bonded MPX. These tokens do not go directly to the proposer. Instead, the tokens are evenly spread among validators. So now each validator&#x27;s pool has 100 MPX. These 100 MPX are distributed according to each participant&#x27;s stake:</p><ul><li>Commission: <code>100*80%*1% = 0.8 MPX</code></li><li>Validator gets: <code>100\*20% + Commission = 20.8 MPX</code></li><li>All delegators get: <code>100\*80% - Commission = 79.2 MPX</code></li></ul><p>Then, each delegator can claim their part of the 79.2 MPX in proportion to their stake in the validator&#x27;s staking pool.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-are-fees-distributed">How are fees distributed?<a href="#how-are-fees-distributed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How are fees distributed?" title="Direct link to How are fees distributed?">â</a></h3><p>Fees are similarly distributed with the exception that the block proposer can get a bonus on the fees of the block they propose if the proposer includes more than the strict minimum of required precommits.</p><p>When a validator is selected to propose the next block, the validator must include at least 2/3 precommits of the previous block. However, an incentive to include more than 2/3 precommits is a bonus. The bonus is linear: it ranges from 1% if the proposer includes 2/3rd precommits (minimum for the block to be valid) to 5% if the proposer includes 100% precommits. Of course the proposer must not wait too long or other validators may timeout and move on to the next proposer. As such, validators have to find a balance between wait-time to get the most signatures and risk of losing out on proposing the next block. This mechanism aims to incentivize non-empty block proposals, better networking between validators, and mitigates censorship.</p><p>For a concrete example to illustrate the aforementioned concept, there are 10 validators with equal stake. Each validator applies a 1% commission rate and has 20% of self-delegated MPX. Now comes a successful block that collects a total of 1025.51020408 MPX in fees.</p><p>First, a 2% tax is applied. The corresponding MPX go to the reserve pool. The reserve pool&#x27;s funds can be allocated through governance to fund bounties and upgrades.</p><ul><li><code>2% * 1025.51020408 = 20.51020408</code> MPX go to the reserve pool.</li></ul><p>1005 MPX now remain. For this example, the proposer included 100% of the signatures in its block so the proposer obtains the full bonus of 5%.</p><p>To solve this simple equation to find the reward R for each validator:</p><p><code>9*R + R + R*5% = 1005 â R = 1005/10.05 = 100</code></p><ul><li>For the proposer validator:<ul><li>The pool obtains <code>R + R * 5%</code>: 105 MPX</li><li>Commission: <code>105 * 80% * 1%</code> = 0.84 MPX</li><li>Validator&#x27;s reward: <code>105 * 20% + Commission</code> = 21.84 MPX</li><li>Delegators&#x27; rewards: <code>105 * 80% - Commission</code> = 83.16 MPX (each delegator is able to claim its portion of these rewards in proportion to their stake)</li></ul></li><li>For each non-proposer validator:<ul><li>The pool obtains R: 100 MPX</li><li>Commission: <code>100 * 80% * 1%</code> = 0.8 MPX</li><li>Validator&#x27;s reward: <code>100 * 20% + Commission</code> = 20.8 MPX</li><li>Delegators&#x27; rewards: <code>100 * 80% - Commission</code> = 79.2 MPX (each delegator is able to claim their portion of these rewards in proportion to their stake)</li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-slashing-conditions">What are the slashing conditions?<a href="#what-are-the-slashing-conditions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are the slashing conditions?" title="Direct link to What are the slashing conditions?">â</a></h3><p>If a validator misbehaves, their delegated stake is partially slashed. Two faults can result in slashing of funds for a validator and their delegators:</p><ul><li><strong>Double signing:</strong> If someone reports on chain A that a validator signed two blocks at the same height on chain A and chain B, and if chain A and chain B share a common ancestor, then this validator gets slashed by 5% on chain A.</li><li><strong>Downtime:</strong> If a validator misses more than <code>50%</code> of the last <code>100</code> blocks, they are slashed by 0.00%.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-validators-required-to-self-delegate-mpx">Are validators required to self-delegate MPX?<a href="#are-validators-required-to-self-delegate-mpx" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Are validators required to self-delegate MPX?" title="Direct link to Are validators required to self-delegate MPX?">â</a></h3><p>Yes, they do need to self-delegate at least <code>1 MPX</code>. Even though there is no obligation for validators to self-delegate more than <code>1 MPX</code>, delegators want their validator to have more self-delegated MPX in their staking pool. In other words, validators share the risk.</p><p>In order for delegators to have some guarantee about how much shared risk their validator has, the validator can signal a minimum amount of self-delegated MPX. If a validator&#x27;s self-delegation goes below the limit that it predefined, the validator gets jailed and kicked out of the active set of validators while its delegators remain bonded to it.</p><p>Note however that it&#x27;s possible that some validators decide to self-delegate via a different address for security reasons.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-prevent-concentration-of-stake-in-the-hands-of-a-few-top-validators">How to prevent concentration of stake in the hands of a few top validators?<a href="#how-to-prevent-concentration-of-stake-in-the-hands-of-a-few-top-validators" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to prevent concentration of stake in the hands of a few top validators?" title="Direct link to How to prevent concentration of stake in the hands of a few top validators?">â</a></h3><p>The community is expected to behave in a smart and self-preserving way. When a mining pool in Bitcoin gets too much mining power the community usually stops contributing to that pool. The CrossFi Chain relies on the same effect. Additionally, when delegaters switch to another validator, they are not subject to the unbonding period, which removes any barrier to quickly redelegating tokens in service of improving decentralization.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements<a href="#technical-requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical Requirements" title="Direct link to Technical Requirements">â</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-hardware-requirements">What are hardware requirements?<a href="#what-are-hardware-requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are hardware requirements?" title="Direct link to What are hardware requirements?">â</a></h3><p>A modest level of hardware specifications is initially required and rises as network use increases.

Because the links to the sentry nodes are in private IP space, an internet-based attack cannot disturb them directly. This strategy ensures that validator block proposals and votes have a much higher chance to make it to the rest of the network.</p><p>For more sentry node details, see the <a href="https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/validators.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tendermint Documentation</a> or the <a href="https://forum.cosmos.network/t/sentry-node-architecture-overview/454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentry Node Architecture Overview</a> on the forum.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://gitlab.dfmx.ae/xfi/xfi-front/crossfi.docs.front/docs/node/validators/validator-faq.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/node/validators/security"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Validator Security</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#general-concepts" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">General Concepts</a><ul><li><a href="#what-is-a-validator" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What is a validator?</a></li><li><a href="#what-is-staking" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What is staking?</a></li><li><a href="#what-is-a-full-node" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What is a full node?</a></li><li><a href="#what-is-a-delegator" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What is a delegator?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#becoming-a-validator" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Becoming a Validator</a><ul><li><a href="#how-to-become-a-validator" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">How to become a validator?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#testnet" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Testnet</a><ul><li><a href="#how-can-i-join-the-testnet" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">How can I join the testnet?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#additional-concepts" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Additional Concepts</a><ul><li><a href="#what-are-the-different-types-of-keys" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What are the different types of keys?</a></li><li><a href="#what-are-the-different-states-a-validator-can-be-in" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What are the different states a validator can be in?</a></li><li><a href="#what-is-self-delegation-how-can-i-increase-my-self-delegation" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What is self-delegation?

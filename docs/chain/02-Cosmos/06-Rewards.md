# Rewards

CrossFi Chain uses the DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus protocol. All MPX holders can choose a validator and delegate tokens to start XFI mining. This transaction is called a bond. After delegation, MPX coins are immediately put into operation. Each new block of XFI coins is distributed among the delegators in proportion to the MPX stakes.

## Key features:

- Given the technical characteristics of the blockchain, the reward for the block/blocks may be less than the commission fee. Thus, the reward itself is not yet a transaction of coins to your address. This is an event in the blockchain that does not require payment of commission fees. You can accumulate rewards and then withdraw all of them in one transaction. However, until you withdraw your rewards, you do not have access to them.

- When you delegate MPX to a validator, you cannot control them. To do this, they must be returned from the stake. This transaction is called unbond. Unbond takes 15 days. During this time, you do not receive any rewards and do not have access to your MPX.

- You can partially do unbond. You can select multiple validators for delegation.

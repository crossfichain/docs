# Tendermint core

**Tendermint Core** is an open source blockchain startup software. It allows you to create applications in any programming language. The key quality of Tendermint is speed. The transaction is included in the block in seconds and does not require time for confirmation.

Tendermint Core architecture is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol. It is secure and eliminates fraud, as the Tendermint algorithm automatically blocks nodes that transmit incorrect information during the validation process.

Tendermint is used for scaling public PoS blockchains. The well-known decentralized, scalable, interoperable ecosystem of interconnected independent Cosmos blockchains is based on the Tendermint Core.

## Benefits of Tendermint:

- Unlimited scaling opportunities.

- High throughput. The peak load can reach 1 million operations per second.

- 5 seconds block time with the possibility of reduction to 1 second.
